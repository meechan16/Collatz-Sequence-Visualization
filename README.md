# Collatz Sequence Visualization

![Collatz Sequence](collatz_sequence_demo.gif)

## Description

This is a Python program that allows users to visualize the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer. The Collatz sequence, also known as the 3x+1 problem, is a famous mathematical conjecture that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture posits that no matter what positive integer you start with, this process will eventually reach the cycle 4, 2, 1, and then repeat indefinitely.

## Features

- Interactive GUI: Users can input a positive integer directly within the graph window.
- Real-time Visualization: The program provides a live visualization of the Collatz sequence as it progresses.
- Simple and Intuitive: Easy-to-use interface for generating and visualizing the Collatz sequence.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the program using `python simulation.py`.
5. Enter a positive integer in the input field and press Enter or click Submit.
6. Watch the Collatz sequence visualization in real-time.
